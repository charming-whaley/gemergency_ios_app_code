# Gemergency

## Overview

<p>We are very excited to present you Gemergency - an iOS help assistant app based on Google Gemma 3n LLM. This project was build for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-gemma-3n-hackathon">Google's hackathon "Google - The Gemma 3n Impact Challenge" on Kaggle</a></p>

<p>In this docs, you will find the info about the creation process of that app, how it works, and how to build your own iOS SwiftUI app with LLM via <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp inference</a></p>

<p>Here is the tech stack for the project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>UI framework - SwiftUI</li>
    <li>Main additional API - MapKit</li>
    <li>The best iOS version for an app - iOS 18</li>
    <li>Future support of iOS - iOS 26</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, we should mention that for this project we used <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp inference</a>, so make sure that you liked that project</p>
