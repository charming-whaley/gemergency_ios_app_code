<h1>üíª Interactive Demonstration Notebook</h1>
<p>For a live, step-by-step walkthrough of the entire project pipeline without needing to set up Docker, please see our demonstration notebook:</p>

<h1>The Purpose of This Notebook</h1>
<p>This notebook is a <b>mock demonstration of the project pipeline</b>, created specifically for presentation and review purposes.</p>
<p>It does <b>not reproduce the full codebase or perform real computations</b> ‚Äî instead, it walks the reader through the key stages of the project (data preparation, training, merging, quantization, inference) using simplified logic, placeholder data, and printed outputs.</p>
<p>Its sole purpose is to help reviewers <b>quickly understand the overall flow and structure</b> of the system without needing to run Docker or examine the full implementation.</p>

    ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Note:</strong> This notebook does <em>not</em> execute real training or quantization ‚Äî these steps are simulated with prints or placeholders to ensure stability in the notebook environment.<br>
    For actual execution, see the <a href="#-setup--usage">Docker setup and source code below</a>.

<p><b>Think of it as a guided tour, not a working prototype.</b></p>
