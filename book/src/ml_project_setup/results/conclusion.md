<h2>Conclusion and Final Model Choice</h2>
<p>The evaluation clearly demonstrates that quantization is not a lossless process. Lower-bit quantizations (<code>Q4_0</code>, <code>Q3_K_S</code>, <code>Q2_K</code>) can catastrophically degrade model safety and reliability, producing dangerously incorrect information.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Unsafe Models</b>: <code>Q4_0</code>, <code>Q3_K_S</code>, and <code>Q2_K</code> are <b>unsafe</b> and must never be deployed in a real-world application.</li>
    <li><b>Viable Models</b>: <code>Q3_K_M</code> and <code>Q3_K_L</code> offer a strong balance of safety and efficiency, making them suitable for environments with limited resources.</li>
    <li><b>Gold Standard</b>: <code>Q4_K_M</code> provides the most comprehensive and safest response.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this project, where user safety in an emergency is the absolute highest priority, we selected the <b><code>Q4_K_M</code> model as our final production choice</b>. The marginal increase in file size is a small price to pay for the significant improvement in the detail, clarity, and trustworthiness of its guidance. Our fine-tuning and evaluation pipeline successfully produced a model that is demonstrably more reliable and fit for the critical purpose of emergency assistance.</p>
