<p>The fine-tuned model demonstrates a clear improvement in providing direct, structured, and safety-conscious advice compared to a more generic base model.</p>
<p><b>Prompt</b>: "What is the first aid for a burn?"</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Plausible Base Model Response</b>: "For a minor burn, you can run cool water over it. For more serious burns, you should seek medical attention. There are different degrees of burns, and treatment can vary." (Helpful, but generic and lacks actionable steps).</li>
    <li><b>Fine-Tuned Model Response</b>: </li>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Stop the Burning Process</b>: Immediately move the person away from the source of the burn.</li>
        <li><b>Cool the Burn</b>: Hold the affected area under cool (not cold) running water for 10-20 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Remove Jewelry</b>: Gently remove any rings or tight items from the burned area before it swells.</li>
        <li><b>Cover the Burn</b>: Apply a sterile, non-adhesive bandage or a clean cloth.</li>
        <li><b>Do Not Apply Ointments</b>: Avoid using butter, oils, or ointments, as they can trap heat. Call for emergency help if the burn is large, deep, or on the face, hands, or genitals." (Specific, actionable, includes crucial warnings).</li>
