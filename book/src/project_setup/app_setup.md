# Setting up iOS app with Gemma 3n

## Preparation

<p>We're now ready to build a brand new SwiftUI iOS app. Before we begin, we need to set up the <b>Xcode framework</b> within the app. To start, we created a new SwiftUI project in Xcode by navigating to <b>Xcode → File → New → Project</b>, selecting SwiftUI as the primary UI framework, and creating a new app.</p>
<p>Next, we need to add the <b>Xcode framework</b> we built earlier to the project. This can be done easily by simply dragging and dropping the framework into our app. Once that's done, we can move on to integrating the necessary controllers into the app.</p>

## Controllers set up



## Further steps

<p>With that completed, we proceeded to develop the Gemergency iOS app. The next steps involved designing the UI with SwiftUI, integrating iOS system features, and implementing other core functionalities.</p>
