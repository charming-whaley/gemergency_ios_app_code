# Setting up iOS app with Gemma 3n

## Preparation

<p>After successfully building <b>llama.xcframework</b>, we can start building our app! First things first, create a new iOS SwiftUI app: go to <b>Xcode -> File -> New -> Project</b>, choose SwiftUI as a primary UI framework, and create that</p>

<p>Now, we need to drag and drop some files from <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp inference</a> into our project:</p>
