# Gemergency

## Intro

<p>We are very excited to present you Gemergency - an iOS help assistant app based on Google Gemma 3n LLM. This project was build for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-gemma-3n-hackathon">Google's hackathon "Google - The Gemma 3n Impact Challenge" on Kaggle</a></p>

## Why This Project Matters

<p>In moments of crisis, every second counts — but most people freeze or forget what to do.  
We believe that <i>everyone</i> deserves instant, trustworthy help, no matter where they are or what device they use.</p>

<p>Our project transforms Google Gemma 3n into an offline-first AI assistant that guides users step by step through emergencies — from home accidents and natural disasters to health crises — with advice that is clear, safe, and scientifically sound.</p>

<p>Unlike most AI apps, our solution is fully functional <b>without internet</b>. That means you can get lifesaving guidance anywhere:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On a plane</li>
    <li>In the wild</li>
    <li>During blackouts</li>
    <li>Or simply when you're overwhelmed and your mind goes blank</li>
</ul> 

<p>We know that under stress, people don’t read instructions — they need actionable, friendly support. Our AI doesn't just repeat generic advice: it provides concise, situation-specific steps.</p>

<b>We are building a world where anyone, anywhere, can get calm, reliable help — even when it feels like there’s no one around.</b><br>
<p>Whether you’re treating a deep cut, coping with a fire, or facing a natural disaster, our offline Gemma 3n assistant is always there for you — no signal, no panic, just help.</p>
